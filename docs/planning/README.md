# Planning

## Roadmap of planning

My stage of planning follows [this article](https://www.juniorjavadeveloper.pl/2020/11/17/stop-zanim-zaczniesz-pisac-kod-zastanow-sie-co-chcesz-kodowac-analiza-projekt-i-implementacja/).

### Steps

- [ ] [Description in text](text_description.md)
- [ ] [CRC cards](crc_cards.md)
- [ ] [ER diagram](er_diagram.md)
- [ ] [Application Architecture](application_architecture.md)
- [ ] [UML class diagram](uml_class_diagram.md)
- [ ] [Endpoints](endpoints.md)

The files associated with the last three steps will be copied to the `docs` folder and developed there, as they are the real documentation of the project and not only an aid in its planning.
